Google translate was used for build 1-10, 11, and coming soon
Check for accuracy please
Unfortunately I had to use Google Translate, as it was the most common one, and it is better than clicking on the wrong link and getting a virus (Windows 10 security in a nutshell)
For some reason, multiple words also give me the same set of characters as the translation. This will definitally need to be corrected in the future
I couldn't find a common word for X (no Xylophone doesn't count) so I chose the name of the Xhosa language
Also I am going to need to keep a low profile for the night, as every change adds an entry to my search history.

Current goals
Get as many different character sets as possible
Add all common languages
Add all common words for a webpage

The letter L currently has the most translations, build 8 really worked on the letter L in Arabic

as of build 9, there are 267 words in English that are listed that start with the letter L

It seems pointless to add in Google Translate, and it is no longer fun with Arabic. I will try to add in words to all languages, and translate a different language tomorrow
